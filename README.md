# GRAPH 
##### the task description
Create the graph library. It should support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
* addVertex - adds a vertex to the graph
* addEdge - adds an edge to the graph
* getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesn't have to be optimal)    

Vertices should be of a user defined type.

Questions to be ready to answer (don't have to implement):
* add weighted edges support in your lib.
* add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.
* make your graph thread safe.
